# DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHM
<h3>Library of integers of arbitrary length(intal)</h3>
<h6>Problem statement</h6>
<p>
Develop a C-library of an integer of arbitrary length, let us call it as “intal” in short. The functionalities to be implemented in the library are declared in the header file (intal.h).
Library "intal", short for integer of arbitrary length, a library of nonnegative integers of 
arbitrary length. The given header file "intal.h" declares the functionalities the library is 
expected to provide except that there is no definition of the "intal" itself. That is left to
the implementation file, which should declare the structure of the intal along with defining
the functionalities declared in intal.h.<br>
 Client treats an intal (an integer of arbitrary length) as an object pointed by a pointer "void*".
An intal can be created by intal_create() by providing a char string of a nonnegative integer provided
in decimal digits. Some intals are created out of some functionalities like intal_add(), which 
creates a new intal. A new intal created must have allocated a dynamic memory (may be by a 
malloc() call). Responsibility of destroying the intals created lies with the client by
calling intal_destroy(), which will free whatever memory allocated during the creation of intal.
Client sees an intal as a "void*". It could be a pointer to char array, int array, long int array, 
double array, or a struct array. There is no theoretical limit to the size of the integer, but memory 
limitations of the process (Operating System). If the OS allows, the library should be able to hold the 
largest prime number known, which is 23,249,425 digits long
